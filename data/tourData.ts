Completed in 1929 after the devastating 1925 earthquake destroyed the previous courthouse, this Spanish-Andalusian masterpiece was designed by architect William Mooser the Third, who had spent years studying architecture in Spain. The courthouse features hand-painted murals by Dan Sayer Groesbeck depicting Santa Barbara's history, from the 1542 landing of Portuguese explorer Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo to the construction of Mission Santa Barbara. The Mural Room took months to complete and covers over 4,200 square feet. Ride the elevator to the 85-foot clock tower for spectacular 360-degree views of the city, mountains, and Pacific Ocean. The building's construction used over 1,500 tons of steel framework to resist earthquakes and cost 1.4 million dollars, equivalent to over 20 million today.",

      narration: "You've arrived at Mission Santa Barbara, known as the Queen of the Missions for its exceptional beauty. Founded on December 4th, 1786 by Father Fermín Lasuén on the feast day of Saint Barbara, this was the tenth of California's 21 missions. Originally planned to open four years earlier by Father Junípero Serra, disagreements between church and state delayed its founding until after Serra's death. The mission was built to convert the Chumash people to Christianity and consolidate Spanish claim on Alta California. The current stone church was rebuilt between 1812 and 1820 after earthquakes destroyed earlier adobe structures. Its distinctive twin towers, the only ones among California missions, house six bells each dedicated to a saint. Mission Santa Barbara is one of only two missions continuously operated by Franciscans since its founding. The grounds include a historic cemetery where California's first bishop, Francisco Garcia Diego y Moreno, is buried alongside four thousand Chumash Indians.",

Founded in 1926 when Anna Dorinda Blaksley Bliss purchased 13 acres in Mission Canyon, the garden was designed by legendary landscape architect Beatrix Farrand and local designer Lockwood de Forest. It has grown to 78 acres featuring over 1,000 species of rare and indigenous plants organized into natural communities including meadows, deserts, and redwood groves. The garden contains a historic treasure: the Mission Dam, a rock structure built in 1806 by Chumash Indians under Spanish direction that once supplied water to Mission Santa Barbara and continued serving the city's water system until 1993. In 2009, the devastating Jesusita Fire burned 80 percent of the garden, but the plant communities have remarkably recovered. With over 5 miles of trails, the garden offers breathtaking views of the Pacific Ocean and Channel Islands from its highest points.",
